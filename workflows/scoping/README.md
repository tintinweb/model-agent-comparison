# Smart Contract Audit Scoping Workflow Comparison

Comparative analysis of AI models executing a structured smart contract audit scoping workflow on the same DeFi meta-vault codebase. (by Claude-4-sonnet)

## Task Overview

**Workflow**: Chonky security scoping workflow for Solidity smart contracts  
**Target**: Size Meta-Vault DeFi system (9 contracts, 684 NSLOC)  
**Objective**: Generate comprehensive audit scoping report with effort estimation

## Results Summary

| Model | Completion | Report Length | Effort Estimate | Execution Quality |
|-------|------------|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Claude 4 Sonnet** | ✅ Complete | 262 lines | 15-20 audit days | Systematic, thorough |
| **GPT-5 Preview** | ⚠️ Abbreviated | 140 lines | 6-8 audit days | Technical, incomplete |

## Key Findings

### Claude 4 Sonnet
- **Strengths**: Complete autonomous execution, comprehensive documentation, audit-ready deliverables
- **Output**: Professional 15-page scoping report with architecture diagrams, risk matrices, user flows
- **Workflow**: Full 4-phase systematic completion with detailed state tracking

### GPT-5 Preview  
- **Strengths**: Technically accurate, concise analysis, good risk identification
- **Limitations**: Stopped execution early, missing comprehensive documentation
- **Output**: Technical memo style, focused but incomplete

## Winner

**Claude 4 Sonnet** demonstrated superior autonomous workflow execution and produced more comprehensive, audit-ready deliverables suitable for professional security assessment.
