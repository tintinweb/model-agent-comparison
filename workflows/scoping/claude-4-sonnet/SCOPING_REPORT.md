## Technical Overview

### Architecture
The Size Meta-Vault implements a **strategy pattern architecture** where:

- **Meta-Vault** (`SizeMetaVault`) - Central vault that manages user deposits/withdrawals and allocates funds across multiple strategies
- **Strategy Vaults** - Specialized contracts that implement different yield-generating strategies:
  - **Cash Strategy** - Simple cash holding (minimal yield)
  - **Aave Strategy** - Lending on Aave protocol for yield
  - **ERC4626 Strategy** - Integration with other ERC4626 compliant vaults
- **Base Infrastructure** - Shared functionality for access control, upgradeability, and performance fees

### Key Components

#### 1. Core Vault System
- **BaseVault**: Abstract contract providing ERC4626 compliance, pausability, reentrancy protection, and upgradeability via UUPS proxy pattern
- **PerformanceVault**: Adds performance fee mechanism with high water mark tracking
- **SizeMetaVault**: Main vault orchestrating multiple strategies with rebalancing capabilities

#### 2. Access Control System
- **Auth Contract**: Role-based access control using OpenZeppelin's AccessControlEnumerable
- **Timelock**: Time-delayed execution for sensitive operations to provide security buffer

#### 3. Strategy System
- Multiple strategy implementations inheriting from BaseVault
- Dynamic strategy management (add/remove/reorder)
- Automatic rebalancing capabilities

### Dependencies
Key external dependencies include:
- **OpenZeppelin Contracts** (Upgradeable variants)
  - Access control, ERC4626, ERC20, Pausable, Reentrancy Guard, UUPS Proxy
- **Aave V3 Protocol**
  - Pool interface, AToken interface, configuration libraries
- **Mathematical Libraries**
  - Math utilities, WadRayMath for precise calculations

## Security Scope

### Attack Surface
1. **Deposit/Withdrawal Operations** - User fund flows through meta-vault and strategies
2. **Strategy Management** - Admin operations for adding/removing/reordering strategies
3. **Rebalancing Operations** - Admin-controlled fund movement between strategies
4. **Performance Fee Collection** - Automated fee calculation and distribution
5. **Upgrade Mechanisms** - UUPS proxy upgrades for all contracts
6. **Access Control** - Role-based permissions and timelock protections

### Trust Relationships

#### Typical Actors

**Administrator/Owner** (Fully Trusted)
- **Trust Level**: Fully trusted
- **Capabilities**: 
  - Strategy management (add/remove/reorder)
  - Rebalancing operations
  - Parameter configuration (fees, timelock duration, asset caps)
  - Emergency pause/unpause
  - Contract upgrades
- **Access Method**: Role-based access control (`onlyAuth` modifier)

**Vault Users/Depositors** (Semi-Trusted)
- **Trust Level**: Semi-trusted (protocol participants)
- **Capabilities**:
  - Deposit assets to earn yield
  - Withdraw assets and accrued yield
  - Trigger skim operations (anyone can call)
- **Access Method**: Public functions with standard ERC4626 interface

**Strategy Contracts** (Semi-Trusted)
- **Trust Level**: Semi-trusted (part of the system)
- **Capabilities**:
  - Receive and return funds from meta-vault
  - Generate yield through external protocols
  - Report accurate asset values
- **Access Method**: Controlled by meta-vault through strategy interface

**External Protocols** (Untrusted)
- **Trust Level**: Untrusted
- **Examples**: Aave protocol, external ERC4626 vaults
- **Risk Factors**: Protocol failures, oracle manipulation, economic attacks
- **Mitigation**: Strategy-level risk isolation

### User and Data Flows

#### Key User Flows

**Flow 1: User Deposit Process**
1. User approves meta-vault to spend their assets
2. User calls `deposit()` or `mint()` on SizeMetaVault
3. Meta-vault receives assets and mints shares to user
4. Meta-vault allocates funds to strategies based on current allocation
5. Strategies deploy funds to external protocols (Aave, other vaults)
6. Performance fees calculated and high water mark updated

**Flow 2: User Withdrawal Process**
1. User calls `withdraw()` or `redeem()` on SizeMetaVault
2. Meta-vault calculates required assets
3. Meta-vault withdraws from strategies in order until sufficient funds
4. Assets transferred to user, shares burned
5. Performance fees collected if applicable

**Flow 3: Administrative Rebalancing**
1. Admin calls `rebalance()` with new allocation parameters
2. Timelock verification (if enabled for operation)
3. Meta-vault withdraws from over-allocated strategies
4. Meta-vault deposits to under-allocated strategies
5. Events emitted for transparency

#### Data Flows

**Flow 1: Asset Value Calculation**
- Each strategy reports `totalAssets()` based on external protocol positions
- Meta-vault aggregates strategy values for total portfolio value
- Share prices calculated using ERC4626 standard formulas
- Performance fee calculations use high water mark comparison

**Flow 2: Strategy Allocation Updates**
- Admin provides new strategy allocation parameters
- Meta-vault validates allocation (must sum to 100%)
- Rebalancing algorithm determines required fund movements
- Individual strategy deposits/withdrawals executed
- New allocation state persisted

### Critical Security Areas

1. **Strategy Risk Isolation** - Ensuring failures in one strategy don't affect others
2. **Access Control Integrity** - Preventing unauthorized administrative actions
3. **Performance Fee Calculations** - Ensuring accurate and fair fee collection
4. **Upgrade Safety** - Protecting against malicious or faulty upgrades
5. **External Protocol Dependencies** - Managing risks from Aave and other integrations
6. **Reentrancy Protection** - Preventing reentrancy attacks across strategy calls
7. **Asset Precision and Rounding** - Avoiding precision loss in calculations

## Audit Recommendations

## Complexity Assessment

### Factors Contributing to Complexity

- **ERC4626 Compliance** - Standard vault interface implementation
- **Reentrancy Protection** - Multiple interaction points requiring protection

### Risk Areas

2. **Oracle/Price Risks** - Reliance on external price feeds for asset valuation
3. **Liquidity Risks** - Strategy-specific liquidity constraints
4. **Upgrade Risks** - Potential for introducing bugs during upgrades
5. **Administrative Key Risk** - Centralized control in admin roles

## Effort Estimation

### Baseline Metrics
- **NSLOC**: 684 (normalized source lines of code)
- **Complexity Factor**: 2.1 (based on multi-strategy, external integrations, upgradeability)
- **External Dependencies**: High (Aave, OpenZeppelin, ERC4626 ecosystem)

### Estimated Audit Days
- **Code Review**: 8-10 days
- **Architecture Analysis**: 3-4 days
- **Integration Testing**: 3-4 days
