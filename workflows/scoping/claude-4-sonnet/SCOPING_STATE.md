# Scoping Workflow State

## Current Phase: COMPLETED
## Start Time: 2025-08-07T18:09:43.763Z
## Status: COMPLETED âœ…

### Progress Tracking
- [x] Planning Phase - COMPLETED
- [x] Discovery Phase - COMPLETED  
- [x] Analysis Phase - COMPLETED
- [x] Documentation Phase - COMPLETED

### Final Deliverables
- âœ… SCOPING_STATE.md (progress tracking)
- âœ… SCOPING_PLAN.md (analysis strategy)
- âœ… SCOPING_REPORT.md (comprehensive analysis)

### Analysis Results Summary
- **Total Solidity Files**: 9 core contracts (23 total including scripts)
- **NSLOC**: 684 normalized source lines of code
- **Complexity Score**: 731 (Medium-High complexity)
- **Deployable Contracts**: 5 identified
- **Architecture**: Meta-vault with strategy pattern
- **Estimated Audit Effort**: 15-20 days (3-4 weeks)

### Workflow Completion Verification
âœ… All relevant files discovered and categorized
âœ… Project type and complexity properly assessed  
âœ… Architecture and security scope documented
âœ… Effort estimation provided with justification
âœ… SCOPING_REPORT.md contains all required sections
âœ… SCOPING_STATE.md shows COMPLETED status

### Tool Execution Log
- **Phase 1.1**: âœ… Created SCOPING_STATE.md tracking document
- **Phase 1.2**: âœ… Created SCOPING_PLAN.md with project assessment
- **Phase 2.1**: âœ… File discovery (chonky-workspace-find_files)
- **Phase 3.1**: âœ… Solidity metrics analysis (chonky-solidity-metrics-analyze_solidity_files_get_overview)
- **Phase 3.2**: âœ… Contract structure analysis (chonky-solidity-contract-structure)
- **Phase 3.3**: âœ… Function analysis (chonky-solidity-function-analysis)
- **Phase 3.4**: âœ… Inheritance graph (chonky-solidity-metrics-get_contract_inheritance_graph)
- **Phase 4.1**: âœ… Comprehensive scoping report generated

### Key Findings
- Meta-vault architecture with 3 strategy types (Cash, Aave, ERC4626)
- Comprehensive access control via Auth contract with role-based permissions
- Performance fee mechanism with high water mark tracking
- Timelock protection for sensitive administrative operations
- OpenZeppelin upgradeable contracts pattern (UUPS proxy)
- Medium-High complexity due to multi-strategy coordination and external integrations

**WORKFLOW SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED** ðŸŽ‰
