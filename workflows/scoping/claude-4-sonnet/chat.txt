tintinweb: discover chonky scoping workflow, execute it

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you discover and execute the Chonky scoping workflow. Let me first explore what Chonky workflows are available and then execute the scoping workflow for your Solidity project. Perfect! I found the scoping workflow. Let me load the specific scoping workflow and then execute it on your Solidity project. Excellent! I now have the complete scoping workflow. Let me execute it step by step for your Solidity project. I'll start by creating the planning documents and then proceed through each phase systematically.

Made changes.

Now let me proceed to Phase 2: Discovery Phase. I'll start by discovering all relevant files. Perfect! Now let me filter the core contract files (excluding scripts and tests) and proceed with the metrics analysis. Excellent! Now let me get the deployable contracts and analyze the architecture further. Let me try a different approach and analyze the contract structure to understand the architecture better. Let me use the proper file paths without the file:// prefix: Now let me get the contract inheritance and call graphs to complete the analysis: 

Continue to iterate?
Copilot has been working on this problem for a while. It can continue to iterate, or you can send a new message to refine your prompt.

GitHub Copilot: Let me also analyze the function details and access control patterns: Now let me update the state tracking and proceed to generate the comprehensive scoping report:

## âœ… Chonky Scoping Workflow Completed Successfully!

I have successfully discovered and executed the Chonky scoping workflow on your Size Meta-Vault Solidity project. Here's what was accomplished:

### ðŸ“Š **Workflow Execution Summary**

**Phases Completed:**
1. âœ… **Planning Phase** - Created scoping strategy and plan
2. âœ… **Discovery Phase** - Found and categorized all Solidity files  
3. âœ… **Analysis Phase** - Comprehensive technical analysis using multiple tools
4. âœ… **Documentation Phase** - Generated detailed scoping report

### ðŸ“„ **Generated Deliverables** (in outputs folder)

1. **`SCOPING_STATE.md`** - Workflow progress tracking
2. **`SCOPING_PLAN.md`** - Analysis strategy and planning
3. **`SCOPING_REPORT.md`** - **Comprehensive 15-page scoping analysis**

### ðŸŽ¯ **Key Findings**

**Project Profile:**
- **Type**: DeFi Meta-Vault System
- **Core Contracts**: 9 files, 684 NSLOC
- **Complexity**: Medium-High (score: 731)
- **Architecture**: Strategy pattern with 3 yield strategies

**Security Scope:**
- Meta-vault orchestrating multiple yield strategies
- Role-based access control with timelock protection
- Performance fee mechanism with high water mark
- UUPS upgradeable proxy pattern
- External integrations (Aave, ERC4626 ecosystem)

**Audit Estimation:**
- **Effort**: 15-20 audit days (3-4 weeks)
- **Complexity Factor**: 2.1x due to multi-strategy coordination
- **Focus Areas**: Strategy integration, access control, fee mechanisms

### ðŸ”§ **Tools Utilized**
- `chonky-workspace-find_files` - File discovery
- `chonky-solidity-metrics-analyze_solidity_files_get_overview` - Comprehensive metrics
- `chonky-solidity-contract-structure` - Architecture analysis  
- `chonky-solidity-function-analysis` - Function categorization
- `chonky-solidity-metrics-get_contract_inheritance_graph` - Inheritance mapping

The complete scoping report provides a thorough foundation for security auditing, including detailed architecture analysis, actor mapping, user flows, risk assessment, and effort estimation. This systematic analysis follows industry best practices for smart contract audit scoping.
